    You can run some RabbitMQ connection samples

    @netcoreapp2.1
    @win10-x64
    Scenario: Rabbit Connector for .Net Core 2.1 (win10-x64)
        Given you have at least .NET Core SDK 2.1.300 installed
        And you have CloudFoundry service p-rabbitmq installed
        When you run: cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitMQService
        And you wait until CloudFoundry service myRabbitMQService is created
        And you run: dotnet restore
        And you run: dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.1 -r win10-x64
        And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/win10-x64/publish
        And you wait until CloudFoundry app rabbitmq-connector is started
        When you post "Message=HEY THERE" to https://rabbitmq-connector.x.y.z/RabbitMQ/Send
        And you get https://rabbitmq-connector.x.y.z/RabbitMQ/Receive
